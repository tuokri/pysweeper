# pysweeper
### Just another CLI minesweeper, implemented in Python3.5.1.


### How to play:
### `python3 main.py`
 

##### Features:
- Customise grid dimensions and amount of bombs from user input.
- Place bombs in random squares.
- Implements flood fill algorithm to open empty squares.
- Saves high scores to a file.
- Probably unnecessarily heavy, because I wanted to experiment in Python OOP.
